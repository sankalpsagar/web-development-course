	I love me some good indie electronic music. Try listening to this gorgeous song, won't you?

	Brighter Side.

	<b><i>WILD</i></b>

	<h6>Note: Since I didn't find any mp3 hosting service that provided me an mp3 link, I had to put up a relative link instead. This html tag will <b>probably</b> not work on any other computer other than mine, unless you ALSO download the music file. Hope this was helpful.</h6>
